# Implement SortingHat: A school hostel assignment Program

### Summary

they registertheirroll number, class & food preference. There are 2 classes - A and B, and two food
preferences - V & NV. There are 4 boarding houses with equal but limited capacity. The hat follows a
first in first out policy with the following rules -
* Queue will be processed based on the time a studentregistered, first in first out
* Boarding houses for students who prefer V cannot board NV students
* Boarding houses for class A would be separate from boarding houses for class B
* Once all boarding houses are filled up to capacity, no more students can be allocated.
* Otherrules
  * Roll numberis a 4 digit integer unique to each student
  * Student can only be registered once, duplicate commands for same student may be ignored.
